        <p>Knowing how to perform your own tune-ups on your vehicles will not only save you potentially thousands of dollars but it will also be able to prolong the life of your vehicles. This could save you tons of time, stress, and aggravation.</p>
        <p>An automotive tune-up consist of changing the oil, replacing/cleaning the air filter, changing out the spark plugs, and rotating the tires. If you want to go a little more in depth you could also clean the MAS (Mass Airflow Sensor) and change out your fuel filter as well. </p>

          <p>A Tune-up covers all of the main components necessary to keep a vehicle running from day to day.</p>
          <p>Here is a list of the tools and supplies you might need for these task.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Oil / Filter</li>
            <li>Oil Filter Wrench</li>
            <li>Oil pan</li>
            <li>Funnel</li>
            <li>Spark plugs</li>
            <li>Rachet and socket for spark plugs</li>
            <li>Tire Iron</li>
            <li>Jack & stands</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Depending on your vehicle you normally change your oil every 3,000 - 10,000 miles.</p>
          <p>The first step is to jack the car up so you can get underneath it to the oil pan. Then, you will want to use your socket set to remove the bolt from the bottom of the oil pan while catching it in a portable oil pan. When all the old oil is removed you can replace the bolt. Next, you will unscrew the oil filer and catch the oil that drips from there. Replace with brand new filter. Lastly, you will lower the car off the jackstands and refill the oil back up with fresh oil according to your vehicles specs. </p>

          <p>An engine needs 3 main components to run. Fuel, Spark, and OXYGEN! Always keep your air filter clean! This is a very simple task to do.</p>
          <p>Simply pop open the hood of your car and locate the air filter inside your air intake. Usually it is a box held shut by 2 to 4 clips. Pop them open and pull the old filter out and replace same way with the brand new one. ALL DONE!</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Spark_Plugs">
          <header id="Spark_Plugs"><span class= "headbg">Spark Plugs</span></header>
          <p>Alright, now lets learn how to change the spark plugs.</p>
          <p>First, you are going to pop the hood again and locate your battery. Disconnect that before doing anything else. Then, remove the coil packs from over the spark plugs, located in the cylinders. Use a long extension and a spark plug socket to remove old plugs. Gap the new plugs according to vehicle specs and reinstall.</p>

          <header id="Tire_Rotation"><span class= "headbg">Tire Rotation</span></header>
          <p>Rotating your tires fequently will extend their longevity!</p>
          <p>For this task you will need to jack the car back up onto jack stands, but before you do that you should break loose all the lug nuts on each tire(IF you skip this your tires will spin when removing). Once the car is up on jacks remove the tires and rotate them with the correct tire required by your tires and/or drivetrain. Usually you can just switch the fronts to the back and vice-versa(Just keep the tires on the same side as they were).</p>

          <p>This last tune-up job takes an hour and helps tremendously.</p>
          <p>Locate the Mass Airflow Sensor bolted onto your intake system. Normally it has 2 philips head screws holding it in along with a wire harness. With the battery dissconnected, unplug the MAS from the intake harness. Remove it by unscrewing the 2 screws gently. Spray it generously with a can of Mass Airflow Sensor cleaner and let it dry for a hour. Reinstall and DONE!</p>
